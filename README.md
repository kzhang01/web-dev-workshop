# Web Dev Workshop (slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SLE8wFRV5TWu82U0W4NVzX1doSiMug4son21kfLCE_c/edit?usp=sharing))

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this app in development mode, run `npm start` in your terminal after navigating to the project folder. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Exercises
To familiar yourself with React, here are some additions you can make to this starter code:
- Styling (practice your CSS skills!)
- Button to decrement the value
- Check value before incrementing/decrementing
  - ex. Maybe we only want values between 0 - 10
- Error message when incrementing/decrementing to a value outside our range
  
If none of these pique your interest, you can try any other features you'd like!
